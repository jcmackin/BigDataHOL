# Big data hands-on lab (HOL) #
<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##
In this hands-on lab (HOL), you will explore U-SQL, a big data language designed to query both structured and unstructured data at any scale.  
You learn how to run U-SQL jobs locally on a development machine to speed up early coding phases or to use Visual Studio debug locally stored code in Visual Studio Code.

In the lab, you are a developer helping to create an apartment rental app called ContosoBNB.  By querying a large dataset made available by [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), you hope to provide the following insights to eventual users of the ContosoBNB app:

+ Current rental rate ranges based on their property location and features.
+ Forecasted rental rates based upon occupancy rates.
+ Potential monthly and yearly revenue for renting a room.


### Objectives
In this hands-on lab, you will:
+ Learn how Azure Data Lake and U-SQL is an alternative to Hadoop/HDFS and Map Reduce.
+ Work with data on your local system and in an Azure Data Lake Store.
+ Execute U-SQL queries on your local system and in Azure Data Lake.
+ Learn how to use existing data to calculate new values in your datasets.
+ Modify queries to address data inconsistency issues.

### Prerequisites

The following are required to complete this hands-on lab:

- An Azure subscription, to perform Azure Data Lake data-transfer exercises

### Resources

This lab makes use of an existing dataset (released under public domain) to model real-world property listings with their associated details. The complete dataset can be found at [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). For the purposes of this lab, the data has been converted to a standard Windows text file format to emulate how it might be provided if requested directly from an Azure Data Lake Store.

## Exercise 1: Create a DSVM


In this exercise, you will create an instance of the DSVM for Windows in Azure. The DSVM for Windows is a VM image in Azure that includes many preinstalled and configured data-science and development tools. You can read a longer description about the many tools and features available in the DSVM [here](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.linux-data-science-vm-ubuntu).


### Step 1: Creating the DSVM in Azure

1.  In a web browser, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/), and then sign in with your Microsoft account.

2.  From the left-side menu, click the **+** sign to add a new resource.

7.  In the **User Name** field, type a user name of your choice. Save this information, because you will use it to sign in to the VM later.

8.  In the **Password** field, enter a password of your choice. Save this information, because you will use it to sign in to the VM later.

9.  In the **Subscription** drop-down menu, select your subscription.

10.  In the **Resource Group** section, leave **Create New** selected, and then enter a name of your choice for the resource group in the field below; for example, **DataScienceGroup1**.

11.  In the **Location** drop-down menu, ensure that a geographically close location is chosen.

12.  Click **OK**.
At this stage, the Choose a Size page appears. Proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Sizing the new VM and reviewing settings

1.  On the **Choose A Size** page, click **View All**.

![ChooseSize](img/ChooseSize.jpg)
3.  In the list of available VM types, select **DS4_V2 Standard**.

![ChooseSize2](img/ChooseSize2.jpg)
4.  Click **Select**.

5.  On the **Settings** page that appears, review the default settings, and then click **OK**. 

The Create page appears, displaying offer details and summary information.

5.  Click **Create**.

**Important: Make sure you return to the Azure portal and shut down this VM after you complete this lab.**

6.  Wait a few minutes while the DSVM is deployed. After it is deployed, you will see a dashboard for your new VM. At the top of the dashboard, you will see controls.

![StartStop](img/StartStop.jpg)

7.  The **Start** button is not available, indicating that the new VM has already started.

### Step 3: Connecting to the new VM
1. If you are on a Mac, download and install [Microsoft Remote Desktop 10](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12) from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12) . 

2. On the control bar for your new VM, click **Connect**.

![Connect](img/Connect.jpg)

This step downloads an RDP file through your browser.  

3. Open the RDP file and connect to the DSVM.

- If you are on a Windows computer, you can open the RDP file through the browser. Click **Connect** when prompted, then supply the credentials you specified in step 1 of this exercise when prompted, and finally click Yes to accept the certificate.

- If you are on a Mac, save the RDP file to a convenient location, and then open the file.  If you are prompted to verify a certificate, click **Continue**. Enter the credentials you specified in the step 1 when prompted.

4.  When you see the DSVM desktop, proceed to the next exercise.

## Exercise 2: Set up the U-SQL local run environment
We are going to run xxx, but these tools are missing some components we need by default.  Before you can run U-SQL queries locally in our source code editor Visual Studio Code, you will need to download and install an additional Visual Studio component, Azure Data Lake Tools, and additional script dependencies. Then you will need to start the Azure Data Lake local run service.
   
### Step 1: Installing the Visual Studio component 
1. In the DSVM, right-click the Start button and select **Search** from the shortcut menu. 

![search](img/search.jpg)
3. In the search box that opens on the right side of the screen, type **Visual Studio Installer**, and then click to open that program when its tile appears below the search box.

![SearchInstaller](img/SearchInstaller.jpg)

4. If you are prompted to update the Visual Studio Installer before proceeding, click Update to perform the update. 
5. In the Visual Studio Installer page that opens, expand the More menu associated with Visual Studio Community 2017, and then click Modify on the menu.

![modify](img/modify.jpg)

6. On the Modifying-Visual Studio Community 2017 page that opens, click **Individual components**.

![ic2](img/ic2.jpg)
7. In the list of individual components, within the **Compilers, build tools, and runtimes category**, select the checkbox associated with **VC++ 2015.3 v140 toolset for desktop (x86,x64)**.

![ic3](img/ic3.jpg)
8. Click Modify.

![ic4](img/ic4.jpg)
The installation will require a few minutes to complete. 
9. After the installation has completed, close the Visual Studio Installer window.
### Step 2: Installing Azure Data Lake Tools in Visual Studio Code
We will be using Visual Studio Code as our source code editor of choice. To make Visual Studio Code compatible with U-SQL, we need to install the Azure Data Lake Tools extension. 
1.  On the desktop the DSVM, locate and double-click the Visual Studio Code icon to open this application.

Visual Studio Code opens, along with a web page about Visual Studio Code and a dialog box about Internet Explorer settings.  

2. Close all open windows except for Visual Studio Code.

3.  In Visual Studio Code, click the **Extensions** icon in the left pane.

![VSCodeExtension](img/VSCext.jpg)

4. In the search box in the top left of the window, enter **Azure Data Lake**

5. Click **Install** next to Azure Data Lake tools.

![ADLsearch](img/ADLsearch.jpg)

The Azure Data Lake Tools extension will install. The process will take a few moments.

6. Click Reload to activate the Azure Data Lake tools extension.

![ADLTreload](img/ADLTreload.jpg)

You can now see Azure Data Lake Tools in the Extensions pane.


### Step 3: Download the lab files and script dependencies in Visual Studio Code

1.	Create a new folder named AzureHOLs in any convenient location on the DSVM. You will use this folder to store lab files.
2.	At a command prompt, navigate to the AzureHOLs folder, and then enter the following command: 

**git clone https://github.com/ProwessInfo/AzureUniversityRedShirt**

3.	Switch to Visual Studio Code. In Visual Studio Code, select **File>Open Folder**, navigate to the AzureHOLs\AzureUniversityRedShirt\Challenges\BigDataHOL folder, and then click Select Folder. 

This step sets Visual Studio Codeâ€™s current working folder. The results should look similar to the following:

![Tree1](img/Tree1.jpg)  


You now need to trigger Visual Studio Code to install dependencies needed to continue.

4. In the explorer pane in Visual Studio Code, expand the Scripts folder within BIGDATAHOL and double-click a script.

If you see a Windows Security Alert that informs you that Windows Defender Firewall has blocked some features of this app, click Allow Access.  

5. If your system has not previously downloaded these dependencies, you will see a Warn message at the top of the window indicating that the binary dependences are being downloaded. After about 2 minutes, you will see a message at the top of the screen indicating that dependencies have completed downloading.

![dependencies](img/dependencies.jpg)  

6. Click **Close** on all open notifications that appear at the top of the window in Visual Studio Code.

### Step 4: Start the Azure Data Lake local run service
